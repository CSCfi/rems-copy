# Ideas
Ideas for features that were not required for the MVP, but could be added later.

- add support for attachment licenses
- consider having a parameter for forcing creation of items that already exist with the same name
- currently the tool does a mass-copy of all items, consider adding a parameter for listing items and moving them individually by identifier
- currently only active items are handled, consider adding a parameter for handling archived and disabled items
